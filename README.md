- Run backend/setup.sql to set up the back end
- Run the backend server with nodemon .\index.js in the backend directory
- Run the frontend website with npm start in the frontend directory
- Requires the creation of a user account to access most of the site, as required by MVP. One known bug when attempting to access the /thread/# endpoint without being logged in.
- I was able to completely fulfill all of MVP minus the test suite! I did try to test out as much as I could with the time I had, but I could not actually write out a test suite.
